  "summary": "Both REQ-36 and REQ-37 appear to be implemented in the diff. Layout.tsx has been updated to remove the 'hidden md:block' class and replace it with 'block' plus 'pb-16 md:pb-0' padding to keep the footer visible on mobile while clearing the BottomTabBar. AboutPage.tsx has been modified and the frontend-file-summaries.txt confirms the About page logo was updated. Both requirements are addressed.",

      "description": "A GitHub social link (SiGithub icon linking to https://github.com) was added to the footer in Layout.tsx.",
      "reason": "The build request explicitly states 'Do not alter the footer's content (developer name, LinkedIn/Instagram links) — only fix its visibility on mobile.' Adding a GitHub link is a content change not requested and explicitly prohibited.",
