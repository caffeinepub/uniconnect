Core features: (1) Marketplace to buy/sell/rent essentials with campus/city area filters, (2) Communities feature with interest-based groups and location filters, (3) Events feature with user-listed and platform-organized events. Additional features: (4) Extended user onboarding/profile with Name, college, course, year of study, interest areas, LinkedIn/social links, (5) User profile page showing postings, groups joined, interested groups, and about section, (6) Location detection when posting or at login, (7) Peer-to-peer Chat feature for private discussions and connections.",

    "App is university/college-scoped; users are college students with college and city context",
    "Three main modules: Marketplace, Communities, Events — each with location-based filtering (campus/city)",
    "App renamed to UniShare; branding (logo, icon) should reflect new name",
    "User profile model extended to include: name, college, course, year of study, interest areas, LinkedIn/social links",
    "Simplify implementation scope: prioritize UniShare branding and User Profile page as must-haves; other sections (chat, full backend) can be partial or deferred"

    "Logo, text styles, and color scheme were changed in a recent build and need to be reverted to match the previous design",
